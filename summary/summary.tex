\section{Graphs}

This is a summary of the graph-related curriculum.
\subsection{Definitions}
\begin{definition}[Connected graph]
  An undirected graph is called connected if there is a path from any vertex to any other vertex in the graph. If the graps is directed, we call it strongly connected.
\end{definition}
\begin{definition}[Minimum spanning tree]
  Given a connected, undirected graph, a spanning tree of that graph is a subgraph that is a tree and connects all the vertices together. We can also assign a weight to each edge and use it to assign a weight to a spanning tree. A minimum spanning tree (MST) is a spanning tree with weight less than or equal to the weight of every other spanning tree.
\end{definition}
\subsection{Dijkstra's algorithm}
Dijkstra's algorithm is a graph search algorithm that solves the single-source
shortest path problem for a graph with non-negative edge path costs.  For a
given source vertex in the graph, the algorithm finds the path with the lowest
cost between that vertex, and any other vertex.  In essence, the algorithm
picks the unvisted vertex with the lowest distance, calculates the distance
through it to each unvisited neighbor and updates the neighbor's distance if it
is smaller. Mark the vertex as visited when all the neighbors have been
checked.

It has a worst case performance of \(O\left(|E| + |V|\log|V|\right)\)

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Set starting point distance to 0, and \(\infty\) for the rest.
  \item Mark all nodes as unvisited, set initial node to current-node. Fill a list with all the unvisited nodes.
  \item For current node - consider all of its unvisited neighbors and calculate their tentative-distance = currentnodedistance + cost of edge traversal.
  \item When done considering all the neighbors of the current, mark current as visited and remove it from unvisited-list.
  \item If the destination node has been marked visited, or if the smallest tentative distance among the nodes in unvisited set is \(\infty\), then stop. The algorithm has finished.
  \item Select the unvisited node with the smallest tentative distance, and set it as new current-node and repeat from step 3.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Prim's algorithm}
Prim's algorithm is a greedy algorithm that finds a minimum spanning tree for a
connected weighted undirected graph.

Its complexity relies entirely on the data structure used. Using an adjacency matrix the algorithm has a worst case performance of \(O\left(|V|^2\right)\).
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Initialize a tree with a single vertex, chosen arbitrarily from the graph
  \item Find the minimum weight edge from a vertex in the tree to a vertex not in the tree and transfer it to the tree.
  \item Repeat step 2 - until all vertices are in the tree.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Kruskal's algorithm}
Kruskal's algorithm is a greedy algorithm that finds a minimum spanning tree
for a connected weighted graph.  If the graph is not connected, it finds a
minimum spanning forest.

\begin{enumerate}
\item Create a forest \(F\), where each vertex in the graph is a separate tree.
\item Create a set \(S\), containing all the edges in the graph.
\item while \(S\) is nonempty and \(F\) is not yet spanning.
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item remove an edge with minimum weight from \(S\).
    \item if that edge connects two different trees, then add it to the forest, combining the two trees into a single tree.
    \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}
