The program compiles as desired on UiO linux machines

The program is run as following:

$ java ProjectManager inputfile.txt

There is no manpower argument, since I chose to not do the optional part.

Delivery status: 
Everything is working as intended.

Code credit:
Everything is written by me, but my implementation of the Tarjan Algorithm
is based on the pseudocode found in the wiki-article for the algorithm.
