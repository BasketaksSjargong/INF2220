INF2220 - Oblig 2 - Report

There are a few main algorithms in my implementation of
this assignment.

1) The implementation of Tarjan's algorithm for finding strongly connected
components in a directed graph is accessing each node once, and each edge at most
twice.

Complexity: O(|V| + |E|)

2) The simulation of the project. Each task is checked once every iteration of the while-loop. Either to check whether it is runnable, or whether it is complete.
The algorithm consists of two for-loops nested inside a while-loop.
The complexity of the for loops are linear, that is O(n).
The complexity of the while loop all depends on the input, but I will approximate it to
O(log n)

Complexity: O(n log n)
