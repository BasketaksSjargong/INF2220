# Generalized Pattern Matching With Wildcards

The task at hand is to implement a generalization of the Boyer-Moore-Horspool bad
character shift algorithm to allow wildcards to be used in the needle.

* Implement a pattern matching algorithm using bad character shift.
* Algorithm must be able to handle several wildcards.
* Implementation must be able to find all occurences of the needle and report the position.
* Program must format the results in an easy-to-read manner.
* The program must output the text in the haystack that matched the needle.
* The program must take two filenames as an argument. First being the needle and second the haystack.
